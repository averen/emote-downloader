# Emote Downloader

This tool quickly and easily downloads all of your Discord emotes for you. All you need is Java installed.

**WARNING:** Discord is not fond of automated user accounts, read more [here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-). Also with recent API changes on Discord's end, this application will not function in the near future. With this in mind, I will no longer be providing support for any issues you encounter. **Use at your own risk.**

You can find the latest pre-built JAR in the [releases](https://github.com/averen/emote-downloader/releases) tab.

### Configuration
This step has been significantly simplified. Instead of creating your own config file, you will instead be prompted for your token when ran for the first time.
